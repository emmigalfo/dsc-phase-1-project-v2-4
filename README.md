## Overview 


This project aims to guide Microsoft as it gets into the movie industry. Through exploratory analysis, factors such as genre, directors, movie runtime, and production budget are analysed to determine effects on net profit and return on investment. It turns out that what is needed for a higher return on investment is different than what is needed for a higher net profit. Higher budget films in the animation, kids & family, and fiction & fantasy genres make more net profit, whereas lower budget films in the horror, special interest, and documentary genres have higher returns on investment. 

## Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to get into the movie industry by starting their own movie studio. They need someone to explore what makes movies successful and provide them with reccommendations. For a business, being profitable is one great way to measure success. This project looks at the following variables and their potential to affect Microsoft's return on investment as well as their net profit:
*  Genre
*  Director
*  Runtime
*  Production Budget

## Data Understanding

In order to see which movies are most successful and why, reliable data is needed! Fortunately, there are plenty of excellent websites which gather all sorts of information on movies. All of the exploratory analysis for this project was able to be done with just two main data sets. 
* First, a data set was collected from the website, The Numbers, which supplies movies budgets and worldwide gross figures. 
* Second, a data set from Rotten Tomatoes was used to get information about movies' genres, directors, and runtime. 
* The two data sets were then joined together to analyse. 

## Data Analysis

#### Before we start...
Let's get an idea of what the data set shows by asking the following questions:
 1. What are the average and median ROI's and net profit?
 2. Which movies had the highest ROI's? 
 3. Which movies had the highest net profit? 

This will help us get a baseline knowledge of what is "normal" for the industry.

Analysis Shows:
* Average net profit: $59 Million
* Median net profit: $8.5 Million
* Min net profit: $-200 Million
     * Movie: Dark Phoenix
* Max net profit: $2.351 Billion
* Movie: Avatar
* Net profit range: $2551 Million
* Average ROI: 3.8
* Median ROI: 0.7
* Min ROI: -1.0
   * Movie: Hayride
* Max ROI: 1799.0
   * Movie: Deep Throat
* ROI range: 1800.0

*Great news for Microsoft! Although there is a huge span when it comes to net profit, the median is around 8.5 million! Looking at what they can expect for a return on investment, there is once again a giagantic range with the min being -1 and a low budget movie like Deep Throat bringing a max ROI of 1799! Here again, great news, while most movies do not have an ROI anywhere close to that of Deep Throat, the median is still positive around 0.7.*
